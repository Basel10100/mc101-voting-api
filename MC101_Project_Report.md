# MC101 Notes & Voting API - Project Report

## 1. General Description

### Application Overview

The MC101 Notes & Voting API is a comprehensive microservices-based web application that combines secure personal note management with a demonstration voting system. The application is designed to showcase enterprise-grade security practices, microservices architecture, and modern cloud deployment patterns.

The Azure Load Testing service has been configured to evaluate the MC101 application's performance under various load conditions. The testing focuses on two primary scenarios to validate both normal operation and error handling capabilities.

#### 7.1 Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Health Endpoint Load Test**
- **Target**: `https://51.12.210.9/health`
- **Purpose**: Validate application health monitoring under load
- **Configuration**:
  - Virtual Users: 50 concurrent users
  - Duration: 5 minutes
  - Ramp-up Time: 1 minute
  - Expected Response: 200 OK with JSON health status

**Scenario 2: Non-Existing Endpoint Test**
- **Target**: `https://51.12.210.9/non-existing`
- **Purpose**: Test error handling and 404 response performance
- **Configuration**:
  - Virtual Users: 20 concurrent users
  - Duration: 2 minutes
  - Ramp-up Time: 30 seconds
  - Expected Response: 404 Not Found

#### 7.2 Load Testing Setup

**Azure Load Testing Resource Configuration:**
```yaml
Resource Name: mc101-load-testing
Resource Group: [Same as VM resource group]
Region: [Same as VM region]
Test Engine: JMeter-based
Test Script: mc101-load-test.jmx
```

**JMeter Test Plan Components:**
- Thread Groups for concurrent user simulation
- HTTP Samplers for endpoint requests
- Response Assertions for validation

- Response Time: < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Throughput: > 100 requests/second
- Success Rate: 99%+
- CPU Utilization: < 70%
- Memory Usage: < 80%

**Non-Existing Endpoint Performance:**
- Response Time: < 100ms (faster due to early 404 return)
- Throughput: > 200 requests/second
- Success Rate: 100% (404 is expected behavior)
- Consistent error handling performance

#### 7.4 Load Testing Access Configuration

# Continuous monitoring during load test
watch -n 5 'curl -k -w "Time: %{time_total}s" -s https://51.12.210.9/health'
```

**CI/CD Integration:**
The load testing is integrated into the deployment pipeline with automated health checks that verify:
- Application responsiveness after deployment
- Health endpoint functionality
- Error handling for invalid requests
- Overall system stability under basic load

#### 7.6 Performance Analysis and Reporting

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
1. **Response Time Distribution**: P50, P95, P99 percentiles
2. **Throughput Metrics**: Requests per second under load
3. **Error Rates**: Failed requests and timeout percentages
4. **Resource Utilization**: VM CPU, memory, and network usage
5. **Scalability Assessment**: Performance degradation patterns

**Test Results Documentation:**
- Screenshots of Azure Load Testing dashboard
- Performance graphs and metrics charts
- Comparative analysis between endpoints
- Recommendations for performance optimization

*Note: Load testing results and screenshots will be captured after Azure Load Testing service setup and test execution.*

---e Functionality:**

1. **User Authentication & Authorization**
   - OAuth2 JWT-based authentication system
   - User registration, login, logout capabilities  
   - Secure password management and profile updates
   - Session management with token blacklisting

2. **Encrypted Personal Notes Management**
   - Two-tier encryption system for maximum security:
     - **Personal Encryption**: User-provided password with PBKDF2-HMAC key derivation
     - **App-level Encryption**: Application-managed encryption using AES-GCM
   - CRUD operations for notes with automatic encryption/decryption
   - Secure key management and salt/nonce storage per note

3. **Voting System (Demonstration)**
   - Candidate management for administrators
   - Secure voting mechanism for authenticated users
   - Real-time vote counting and result aggregation
   - Admin-level voting analytics

**How It Works:**

The application follows a microservices architecture pattern where each service handles a specific domain:

- Users register and authenticate through OAuth2 JWT tokens
- Personal notes are encrypted using industry-standard AES-GCM encryption
- The voting system allows users to cast votes for predefined candidates
- All data is persisted in PostgreSQL with proper relational modeling
- Nginx serves as a reverse proxy with load balancing, TLS termination, and security headers
- Automated backup systems ensure data persistence and disaster recovery

## 4. CCSK V5 Best Practices Not Implemented

Based on the Cloud Security Alliance's CCSK V5 framework and the referenced research article by Butt et al. (2023), the following critical cloud security practices are **not implemented** in this project:

### 4.1 Identity Federation and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
**CCSK V5 Domain**: Identity, Entitlement & Access Management

**Current Gap**: The application relies solely on username/password authentication without multi-factor authentication or identity federation capabilities.

**Recommendation**: 
- Implement TOTP/SMS-based MFA for enhanced authentication
- Integrate with identity providers (Azure AD, Google, AWS Cognito)
- Add adaptive authentication based on risk factors (location, device)

**Security Impact**: Single-factor authentication increases the risk of account compromise through credential theft or brute-force attacks.

### 4.2 Cloud Security Monitoring and SIEM Integration
**CCSK V5 Domain**: Cloud Application Security & DevSecOps

**Current Gap**: While the application implements basic logging, it lacks comprehensive security monitoring, anomaly detection, and SIEM integration.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement centralized log aggregation (ELK Stack, Splunk, or Azure Sentinel)
- Add real-time security event correlation and alerting
- Deploy behavioral analytics for anomaly detection
- Integrate with cloud security monitoring services

**Security Impact**: Limited visibility into security events reduces incident response capabilities and threat detection effectiveness.

### 4.3 Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Cloud Data Governance
**CCSK V5 Domain**: Data Security & Encryption

**Current Gap**: The application encrypts data at rest but lacks comprehensive data classification, DLP policies, and data governance frameworks.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement data classification schemes for sensitive information
- Deploy DLP controls to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration
- Add data retention and deletion policies aligned with compliance requirements
- Implement data discovery and inventory management

**Security Impact**: Without proper data governance, organizations risk compliance violations, data breaches, and ineffective data protection strategies.

### Reference Validation

These gaps align with the cloud security challenges identified in the research by Butt, Amin, Mehmood et al. (2023), particularly in the areas of:
- **Authentication Vulnerabilities**: Multi-factor authentication gaps
- **Monitoring Limitations**: Insufficient security event correlation
- **Data Governance Challenges**: Lack of comprehensive data protection policies
